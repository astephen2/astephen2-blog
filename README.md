This is the source code for my blog, [RamblingRaptors.com](http://www.ramblingraptors.com). The site is currently being driven by the [Harp.JS webserver](http://www.harpjs.com).Feel free to fork my code, make comments, or contact me.

## Website Design
Credit for the website has to go to [Matt McCormick](www.mbmccormick.com). He did an amazing job building the site. He initially got the code for the original design and insipiration from [Erik Eng](http://erikeng.se/). While many of his design elements are still in use in my website's current design, I have made the following changes to his code:

* Moved the site over from Jekyll to HarpJS
* Moved all templating over to EJS/Jade
* Moved all css over to SASS
