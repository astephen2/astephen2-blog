Welcome to my part of the interwebs. I'm a college student majoring in Computer Science, looking to spread what little I know with the rest of the world. So first of all, what's with the name? Rambling Raptors...

First, I wanted to be clear that this will be a haphazard place. They'll be some coding. They'll be some ranting. They'll be the blogging equivalent of a circus juggling monkey on a unicycle. Possibly.

Secondly, there's alliteration and the obligatory pop-culture reference (so three reasons). People are defined by their actions. What I love defines me. So a statement about what I love describes me more than a flowery paragraph full of fancy jargon from a high-school English class. Jurassic Park is my favorite movie so...raptors. 

There you go. Welcome to Rambling Raptors. Cue the John Williams score. We spared all expense.
